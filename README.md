# Purrfect Leap

Happy playing!
[Demo link:](https://purrfect-leap-vvws.vercel.app/)

The game Purrfect Leap is created by 5 frontend developers by using TypeScript in OOP and p5.js. Try out the fast-pacing multplayer game (up to 4 players) where you, as a cute cat character jump on top of the platforms to survive as long as possible. But be careful there are some platforms that will break and the longer you survive the faster the gameboard will go. Take the power-ups in form of catnip that makes the cat jump to the top or the extra life that shoots the cat up to the top if you fall out of the gameboard. 

## Inspiration

The game is inspired by the popular game Doodle Jump and all the objects in the gameboard (platforms, cats, background and power-ups) are created by me and one of my group members using Affinity Designer. The cat characters are our 4 developers cats in real life :)

### Further updates

Further functions we would like to include when we have thime: 
1. Make the platforms fall faster and genereate more along with the speed of the gameboard
2. Fix power-up bug where the extra life only works if the player jumps on a platform first
3. Maybe add a roof for the game so the player won't be able to jump out of screen when they are at the top
4. Add the last power-up, a ball of garn that the player will be able to throw at another player so they freeze for some seconds
5. And more...
